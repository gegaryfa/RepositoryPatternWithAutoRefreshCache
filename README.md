# Repository Pattern With Auto-Refresh Cache

![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gegaryfa/RepositoryPatternWithAutoRefreshCache)

.Net Core API - Repository pattern with auto refresh cache. This is a simple API using the repository design pattern to get data from a database. The data from the database are being cached either InMemory or in Redis(for scaled systems).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, open a terminal and run `make` to see all the possible actions.
![makefile](https://github.com/gegaryfa/RepositoryPatternWithAutoRefreshCache/img/make.png)

### Prerequisites

* [`GNU Make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [`.Net Core v3.1`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
* [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* Your favorite IDE/editor


### Installing

I created a makefile to make it as easy as possible to get the docker containers up and runnig ðŸ˜Ž. The only thing you need to do is run:

```
make up
```
After that you need to wait for the project to build and you are all set!
The make command will run the docker-compose file and download all the images required for the porject. This will take some time so be patient â˜•.
When the `make up` command is finished, you should have 2 containers running:
- The web API @: http://localhost:8000/ 
- A SQL server with some dummy data already seeded in a database.

Alternatively, you can run the `RepositoryWithCaching.WebApi` project which will use In-memory(by default) data instead of a database on a sql server.
